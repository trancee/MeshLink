# Release Decision: SC-004 Closure

## Purpose

Capture the remaining release-decision path for `SC-004` so reviewers can see
whether the feature is being held to full conformance or shipped under an
explicit waiver / known limitation.

## Current Status

- **Status**: Open
- **Blocking requirement**: `SC-004`
- **Current blocker**: iOS single-hop 64 KiB throughput on the MeshLink path
  remains below the normative `>= 60 KB/s` target on reference benchmark
  hardware.
- **Non-blocker evidence already restored**: recipient-confirmed 64 KiB proof
  completion on the Samsung / OPPO physical path.

## Allowed Closure Paths

### 1. Conformance path

- Retain passing iOS `SC-004` evidence on reference benchmark hardware.
- Keep recipient-confirmed proof evidence aligned with the scored run.
- Update `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `benchmarks/README.md`, and `research.md`.

### 2. Explicit waiver / known-limitation path

- Record stakeholder approval for shipping with the iOS throughput gap.
- Narrow any public iOS large-transfer performance claim to match retained
  evidence.
- Link the accepted residual risk and supporting evidence in the canonical
  docs.

## Evidence Sources

- `specs/001-ble-mesh-sdk/spec.md`
- `specs/001-ble-mesh-sdk/plan.md`
- `specs/001-ble-mesh-sdk/research.md`
- `benchmarks/README.md`

## Update Rule

Whenever the chosen closure path changes, this file MUST be updated in the same
change set as the corresponding `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` updates.
