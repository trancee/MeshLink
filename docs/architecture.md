MeshLink is structured as a layered library with a clean boundary between
platform-agnostic logic (in `commonMain`) and platform-specific I/O (in
`androidMain` / `iosMain`). Approximately 85% of the code is shared.

## Routing

`RoutingEngine` is the facade that consolidates routing table management,
peer presence tracking, message deduplication, gossip preparation
(split-horizon / poison-reverse), and adaptive gossip timing behind sealed
result types (`NextHopResult`, `RouteLearnResult`). MeshLink delegates all
routing decisions to `RoutingEngine` and pattern-matches on results.

MeshLink uses an enhanced DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector)
protocol with gossip-based route propagation.

### Routing Table

`RoutingTable` maintains destination → route mappings with:

- **Sequence numbers** — DSDV ordering (higher wins for same destination)
- **Route expiry** — configurable TTL for stale routes
- **Settling delay** — hold new routes briefly before advertising
- **Holddown timer** — suppress route flapping
- **Neighbor cap** — limit routing table entries proportional to neighbor count
- **Primary + backup** — tracks multiple next-hops per destination

### Composite Cost Metric

`RouteCostCalculator` produces a cost value from four inputs:

```
cost = (rssiBase × lossMultiplier × freshnessPenalty) + stabilityPenalty

Where:
  rssiBase         = (rssi − (−20)) / (−100 − (−20))        ∈ [0, 1]
  lossMultiplier   = 1 / (1 − packetLossRate)                1.0 at 0%, 100 at 99%
  freshnessPenalty  = 1.0 + ageMillis / freshnessHalfLifeMillis      1.0 new, 2.0 at half-life
  stabilityPenalty  = flapCount × penaltyPerFlap (default 0.1)
```

Lower cost is better. The result is clamped to `(0, MAX_ROUTE_COST]`.

### Gossip Protocol

`GossipTracker` implements differential gossip to minimize bandwidth:

1. **Per-peer state tracking** — remembers which routes were last sent to each
   peer (destination, sequence number, cost).
2. **Diff computation** — `computeDiff()` returns only routes that are new or
   changed since the last advertisement to that peer.
3. **Withdrawal detection** — `computeWithdrawals()` identifies routes the peer
   knows about but we no longer have (sent with `cost = ∞`).
4. **Triggered updates** — a cost change exceeding `triggeredUpdateThreshold`
   (default 30%) triggers an immediate advertisement, batched within
   `triggeredUpdateBatchMillis` (default 100 ms).

### Deduplication

`DedupSet` is an LRU set (default 10K entries) that tracks message IDs. When a
message arrives, `tryInsert()` returns `true` if the ID is new, `false` if
already seen. On capacity overflow, the least-recently-used entry is evicted.

---

## Security Model

MeshLink implements a two-layer encryption architecture when a `CryptoProvider`
is supplied. For full details, see [design.md §5](design.md#5-security) and
[diagrams.md § Noise XX Handshake](diagrams.md#5-noise-xx-handshake).

| Layer | Protocol | Scope | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| Hop-by-hop | Noise XX | Per BLE link | Mutual authentication, session keys, forward secrecy |
| End-to-end | Noise K | Per message | Sender-authenticated encryption, relay-opaque |

**Key components:**

- `SecurityEngine` — facade consolidating E2E encryption, signatures, handshakes, and peer key lifecycle
- `NoiseXXHandshake` + `PeerHandshakeManager` — 3-message mutual auth handshake
- `NoiseKSealer` — per-message E2E encryption (48B overhead: 32B ephemeral key + 16B auth tag)
- `ReplayGuard` — 64-entry sliding window bitmask per sender
- `TrustStore` — TOFI key pinning with `STRICT` and `SOFT_REPIN` modes

**Cryptographic primitives** — all pure Kotlin with no native bindings:
Ed25519 (signatures), X25519 (key agreement), ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD),
SHA-256 (hashing), HKDF-SHA256 (key derivation).

---

## Power Management

`PowerCoordinator` is the facade that consolidates power-mode transitions
(with hysteresis), memory-pressure evaluation, and buffer-pressure monitoring
behind sealed result types. For full details and state diagrams, see
[design.md §7](design.md#7-power-management) and
[diagrams.md § Power Mode Transitions](diagrams.md#6-power-mode-transitions).

MeshLink automatically adapts BLE behavior based on battery level across
three tiers:

| Mode | Battery | Adv Interval | Scan Duty | Max Transfers | Chunk Payload |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| PERFORMANCE | >80% or charging | 250 ms | 80% | 8 | 8,192 B |
| BALANCED | 30–80% | 500 ms | 50% | 4 | 4,096 B |
| POWER_SAVER | <30% | 1,000 ms | 16% | 1 | 1,024 B |

Thresholds configurable via `powerModeThresholds` (default `[80, 30]`).
Downward transitions delayed by 30s hysteresis; upward transitions and
charging are immediate. Memory pressure shedding escalates through three
levels (MODERATE → HIGH → CRITICAL) based on buffer utilization.

---

## Transfer & Congestion Control

`TransferEngine` consolidates outbound chunking and inbound reassembly behind
sealed result types. For wire format details, see
[wire-format-spec.md](wire-format-spec.md) and
[diagrams.md § GATT Chunking & SACK Flow](diagrams.md#7-gatt-chunking--sack-flow).

- **Chunking** — messages larger than `mtu - 21` bytes are split into chunks
  with a 21-byte header (type + messageId + seqNum + totalChunks).
- **SACK** — receiver tracks arrivals via `SackTracker` (cumulative ackSeq +
  64-bit bitmask). Sender retransmits only missing chunks.
- **AIMD congestion control** — `AimdController` increases the window by 2
  after 4 clean rounds; halves it after 2 consecutive timeouts
  (min: `ackWindowMin`, max: `ackWindowMax`).
- **Transfer scheduling** — `TransferScheduler` limits concurrent transfers
  per power mode and uses weighted round-robin interleaving.

---

## Extension Points

MeshLink is designed for testability and platform flexibility through three
key interfaces:

### BleTransport

**Purpose:** Abstract BLE hardware so `MeshLink` never touches platform APIs
directly.

| Implementation | Platform | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| `AndroidBleTransport` | Android | GATT server/client + L2CAP CoC |
| `IosBleTransport` | iOS | CoreBluetooth central/peripheral |
| `VirtualMeshTransport` | Tests | In-memory simulated mesh (no hardware) |

### CryptoProvider

**Purpose:** Abstract cryptographic primitives for cross-platform support and
testing.

| Implementation | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `PureKotlinCryptoProvider` | Pure Kotlin crypto (used on all platforms) |

Created via the `expect`/`actual` factory: `createCryptoProvider()`.

### SecureStorage

**Purpose:** Abstract platform-specific secure key-value storage.

| Implementation | Platform | Backend |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| `EncryptedSharedPreferences` | Android | Android Keystore |
| Keychain wrapper | iOS | `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` |
| `InMemorySecureStorage` | Tests | In-memory `Map` |

---

## Wire Protocol

MeshLink uses a binary wire protocol (version 1.0) with 11 message types.

### Message Types

| Type Byte | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `0x00` | `TYPE_BROADCAST` | Unencrypted broadcast message |
| `0x01` | `TYPE_HANDSHAKE` | Noise XX handshake message |
| `0x02` | `TYPE_ROUTE_UPDATE` | DSDV route advertisement (gossip) |
| `0x03` | `TYPE_CHUNK` | Unicast message chunk |
| `0x04` | `TYPE_CHUNK_ACK` | Chunk acknowledgement with SACK |
| `0x05` | `TYPE_ROUTED_MESSAGE` | Multi-hop forwarded message |
| `0x06` | `TYPE_DELIVERY_ACK` | End-to-end delivery confirmation |
| `0x07` | `TYPE_RESUME_REQUEST` | Resume an interrupted transfer |
| `0x08` | `TYPE_KEEPALIVE` | Idle connection keepalive |
| `0x09` | `TYPE_NACK` | Negative acknowledgement |
| `0x0A` | `TYPE_ROTATION` | Identity key rotation announcement |

### BLE Advertisement Payload

17 bytes: `version+power(1B) + keyHash(16B)`

- Bits 0–3 of byte 0: protocol version
- Bits 4–5 of byte 0: power mode (0 = PERFORMANCE, 1 = BALANCED, 2 = POWER_SAVER)
- Bytes 1–16: truncated SHA-256 of the local Ed25519 public key

### Byte Order

All multi-byte integers in chunk headers and ACKs use **little-endian** byte
order. See `docs/wire-format-spec.md` for the complete protocol specification.

| JVM | — | For desktop/server testing |

### Dependencies

- `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.10.2` — the **only**
  runtime dependency.
- All cryptography is pure Kotlin (no BouncyCastle, no native libs).

### expect/actual Pattern

Platform-specific code uses Kotlin's `expect`/`actual` mechanism:

| expect Declaration | Android actual | iOS actual |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| `createCryptoProvider()` | `PureKotlinCryptoProvider` | `PureKotlinCryptoProvider` |
| `createPlatformLock()` | JVM `ReentrantLock` wrapper | iOS mutex wrapper |
| `currentTimeMillis()` | `System.currentTimeMillis()` | iOS time function |
